# mothurMicrobiomeCoreIsolation
Batch script for processing 16S rRNA samples and to identify a shared (core) set of gene sequences in mothur.

The attached batch script was adapted from the MiSeq SOP found at https://mothur.org/wiki/miseq_sop/ and cited as: 
Kozich JJ, Westcott SL, Baxter NT, Highlander SK, Schloss PD. (2013): Development of a dual-index sequencing strategy and curation pipeline for analyzing amplicon sequence data on the MiSeq Illumina sequencing platform. Applied and Environmental Microbiology. 79(17):5112-20.

Specific methodology outlining the processes utilized in this batch file can be found in our publication where the core isolation was used:
